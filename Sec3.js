Doubts:
Different font size units expkanation. Why is rem better and how exactly does it work ?
Difference between girds and flexboxes, and how do they work in depth ?

use
display: flex 
for navbars or header

use 
margin-right:auto 
to stick stuff to the right

when you use HTML properties in JSX, they're camelCased instead of lowercase. e.g., onclick becomes onCLick.
